/* The List component should render markup matching the design.html: a section with a class of 'List', containing a header and div with class 'List-cards'.
The List component accepts 2 props: header and cards.
header is a string of the header of the card to render.
cards is an array of card objects. Each object should have a title and content.
These props will be passed in for each List from the App component.
The List should render a Card component for each of the cards in the cards array prop.
Each instance of the Card component should be passed 2 props (and a key). The 2 props are title and content.
The title prop is a string for the Card's title.
The content prop is a string of the Card's content.*/
